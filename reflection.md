What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think this assignment went very well for (especially considering I am new to python). It really helped to start the program with another person. We were able to bounce ideas off one another, she brought a fresh perspective, and it even just helped me feel less alone when I was struggling. Additionally, spacing the assignment out helped. At first, I was just attempting to complete it all at once like I am used to doing in my previous computer science classes. However, I quickly realized that was not going to work. The first night I pretty much just stared at my code (with Ruby) for nearly an hour before we gave up. It was not something that worked for me at all. Once I started taking breaks, I found that a fresh perspective each time helped me to identify my bugs and errors. My advice for someone taking this course in the future would be to go to office hours. It really helped to get feedback on our initial attempts and to get clarification becasue once that happened it felt like the whole assignment made so much more sense.
